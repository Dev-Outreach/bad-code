Welcome To Bad Code and Pointers on how to improve code.

this repo contains a wiki that informs you on common "bad" code mistakes and gives solutions/pointers on one or more ways to imporve them. There is a single markdown file summarizing the points made in the wiki.

Nothing is required to view the wiki or single markdown file as they should be easily viewed/read through github
